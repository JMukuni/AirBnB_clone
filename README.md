# Airbnb Clone Project

This repository contains the first steps of the AirBnB clone project. During this first part of the project we had to::

- Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

  - [do_create()](./console.py): Creates a new instance of a specific class and saves it (to the JSON file).
  - [do_show()](./console.py): Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
  - [do_destroy()](./console.py): Deletes an instance based on the class name and id
  - [do_all()](./console.py): Shows all the instances that are alocated into the file.json based or not on the class name
